            <b>Preparation</b><br>
            1. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large pot on medium heat. Add chicken, salt and pepper, and brown -
            make
            sure to cook through. Set chicken aside.<br>
            2. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil and the onion into the pot and stir. Cook down for 1-2 minutes.<br>
            3. Add mushrooms and garlic, and stir to incorporate with the onion. Season with salt and pepper to taste as
            well as thyme and paprika. Stir to evenly season.<br>
            4. Add chicken broth and heavy cream to the pot and stir. Bring to a boil, then add the farfalle pasta.<br>
            5. Cook according to package instructions, being sure to stir every 1-2 minutes to keep the pasta from
            clumping
            together. (Cook time may be a little longer in this recipe than when the pasta is boiled in water.)<br>
            6. When the farfalle pasta is al dente, add the spinach and chicken and stir until the spinach cooks down
            and
            incorporates.<br>
            7. Add parmesan and stir until it’s well-incorporated and you’re left with a smooth sauce.<br>
            8. Top off with extra parmesan and serve.<br>
            9. Enjoy!
